ConvertItAll
============

A Converter for Android supporting multiple color themes

ConvertItAll was the my first big Android Application. I learned many things working on it, but I never could make it to something. I had some Ads in it and gained a bit, back when I released this apps first versions on XDA (Link: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1960295).
Not to long ago I released ConvertItAll on the Play Store (Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.funceptionapps.convertitall), but at that time I already started working on a new project, so I lost interest in ConvertItAll. For everyone, who wants to see my first "big" Android Application Project, please feel free to look at the code and also copy and use it, following the Apache License, Version 2.0, under which this Code is released.
If you want to use the code or if you have questions, you can sent me a mail to funceptionapps@gmail.com
